# Canvas-Texting

This program uses the Canvas API to retrieve a user's "ToDo List" and will send the user a text if they have any assignments due on that specific day. 
In order to use this program, users must create their own config file consisting of 4 parts:

1. A User Token for their canvas account. This can be generated by going to your Canvas profile, navigating to the "Settings" tab, and clicking "+ New Access Token". This is what you will need in order to retreive data.
2. The email address to receive texts from. If you do not use a Gmail account, you will need to alter the "SendText" method to use a different Smtp address/process.
3. The password for the email. For a Gmail account, you need to have two-factor authentication set-up, and will need to generate an app password. More info on this can be found here: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en
4. A phone number to receive texts at. In my case, I have an AT&T number so I was able to append "@txt.att.net" to the end of my number and had no further issues. This process will likely be different for different carriers.

In order to make this efficient, you will want to create an executable of this program and run it with either Windows Scheduler, or a CronJob on Mac.
